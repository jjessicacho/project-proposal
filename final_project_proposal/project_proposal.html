                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Client:</strong> Oh! Zzhusam Korean Restaurant</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Type:</strong> Family style Korean restaurant located in Burnaby BC Canada</li>
                        <li><strong>Problems:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The 3rd party of delivery companies/partners such as UberEats, DoorDash, SkipTheDish take 25-30% of the store's profits from delivery orders.</li>
                                <li>Those delivery platforms are also too complicated to manage, especially during busy hours. This resulted customers do not receive any notifications when their order is cancelled.</li>
                                <li>With social network platforms, it is difficult to showcase and update their menu on online in a regular base.</li>
                                <li>Many customers are often confused about the price and the portion size due to lack of understanding Korean dining culture.</li>
                                <li>Although their business has been going for years, there are still few customers having hard time finding the store's location and some available parking lot spaces near to the store.</li>
